# Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project- Ecommerce store - Milestone 5 Project 
## Project Entrails

<p> An eccomerce site will be built which will sell t-shirts for men, women and children. The user should be able to filter the t-shirts using the options: men, women and children. In order to buy the t-shirts the user will have to register with a username and password and login. The registration and username will be
a secure application using the authentication process. The user will navigate through the site using a navbar  through : Home, Cart, Login and Register.  The user once logged in can pay for the item using the strip authentication system. Logged in users are able to leave feedback for the site interms of 'likes' and a feedback review on the item purchased.
Logged in users can only edit there own feedback. Users will not be able to delete items from the website or delete reviews from other users. Git and GitHub will be used for version control. The final site will be deployed and hosted on Heroku.</p>
